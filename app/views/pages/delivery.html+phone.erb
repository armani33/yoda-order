    <h1>Delivery</h1>
    <br>
    <p>We’re doing everything in our power for this date to be as soon as possible. We are targeting Spring 2020. Bear in mind however that some things are out of our hands. These include our suppliers timelines and the timeline of the administration providing the homologation. We will keep you informed at every step.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Our prices do not include delivery. You have the option to pick up your Yoda at our main office in Brussels Belgium, free of charge, or have the Yoda delivered to you at an address in Belgium, for a fee.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Once your bike is ready, our delivery partner will get in touch with you to arrange for a delivery date and time. You’ll get a box and instructions and tools to finalize assembly (it will take 5 minutes and require no skills).</p>
