    <h2>The Yoda riding experience</h2>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h5>Is this an e-bike, a moped, or what?</h5>
      <p>The Yoda bike was designed to provide the riding experience of a bike (everyone knows how to ride a bicycle), with the advantages of a motorcycle (you can go up to 45 km/h without sweating).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h5>Do I need a license/license plate/insurance to drive a Yoda?</h5>
      <p>When renting a Yoda from us (Belgium,), you need either a type B license (regular car license), or an A3 or AM motorcycle license. You are insured for rides made through our application.</p>
      <p>To use your own Yoda, you may need a license, license plate, and insurance depending on the laws of the country in which you ride. For instance in Belgium, you will need:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Either a type B license (regular car license), or an A3 or AM motorcycle license (which can be obtained if you are 16 or above).</li>
        <li>To apply for a license plate for class B mopeds. These begin with the letters “SB”.</li>
        <li>A liability insurance policy (”Burgerlijke Aansprakelijkheid”/“Responsabilité Civile”).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We will provide you with detailed step-by-step guidance when delivering your Yoda to you.</p>
